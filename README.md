# Text-Guided AVIGATE: Audio-Guided Video Representation with Text-Guided Gated Attention for Text-to-Video Retrieval
**(Based on AVIGATE, CVPR 2025 Oral)**

This repository provides an extended implementation of [AVIGATE (CVPR 2025 Oral)]([https://github.com/BoseungJeong/AVIGATE-CVPR2025]) with a multi-level **Text-Guided (Query-Aware)** mechanism.

The goal of this project is to improve Text-to-Video Retrieval performance by allowing the semantic intent of the text query (T) to dynamically influence and control the audio-visual (V-A) fusion process.

## Performance

On MSRVTT (CLIP-ViT B/32):
| Model | R@1 | R@5 | R@10 |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Original AVIGATE (CVPR 2025) | 50.2% | 74.3% | 83.2% |
| GAID (Recent SOTA) | 55.0% | 83.0% | 89.9% |
| **Text-Guided AVIGATE (Ours)** | **63.9%** | **88.0%** | **93.1%** |

*(This work achieved a **+13.7%p** improvement in R@1 over the original SOTA baseline.)*

## 1. Problem: The 'Text-Agnostic' Limitation of AVIGATE

The original AVIGATE model achieves SOTA by selectively fusing audio (A) and visual (V) information using a Gated Fusion Transformer.

However, this fusion process is **Text-Agnostic**. The gating mechanism only considers the relationship *within* the video (V-A interaction) and **completely ignores the text query (T)**.

This is suboptimal. The relevance of an audio cue is highly dependent on the text query.

## 2. Solution: 'Query-Aware' (Text-Guided) Architecture

To solve this, I redesigned the Gated Fusion Transformer to be **Query-Aware**, making the text query (T) an active participant in the fusion process at multiple levels.

### Key Architectural Contributions:

1.  **Text-Conditioned Gating Function :**
    The `Gating Function` was modified to accept the Text Embedding (T) as an additional condition. This allows the model to decide *how much* audio to fuse based on *what* the user is searching for (the semantic intent of T).

2.  **Text-Injected MHA Query :**
    The `MHA` (Multi-Head Attention) block was modified. The Text Embedding (T) is now injected directly into the Visual Frame Query. This allows the model to look for text and video-relevant audio features.

3.  **Gated Text Injection (Gate for L-Injection):**
    To prevent the text query from overpowering the visual features, a **new MLP gate** was implemented. This gate dynamically controls the *amount* of text information (T) injected into the MHA Query, based on the context of all three modalities (T, V, and A).

## Requirement
```sh
# From CLIP
conda install --yes -c pytorch pytorch=1.7.1 torchvision cudatoolkit=11.0
pip install ftfy regex tqdm
pip install opencv-python boto3 requests pandas
```
### Conda Environment
```sh
conda env create --file video.yml
```
## Data Preparing

**For MSRVTT**

The official data and video links can be found in [link](http://ms-multimedia-challenge.com/2017/dataset). 

For the convenience, you can also download the splits and captions by,
```sh
wget https://github.com/ArrowLuo/CLIP4Clip/releases/download/v0.0/msrvtt_data.zip
```

Besides, the raw videos can be found in [sharing](https://github.com/m-bain/frozen-in-time#-finetuning-benchmarks-msr-vtt) from *Frozen️ in Time*, i.e.,
```sh
wget https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~maxbain/frozen-in-time/data/MSRVTT.zip
```
For videos without audio signals, we obtained audio sources using external crawling tools like [youtube-dl](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp).  
We get 9,582 audio signals for 10,000 videos.

## Compress Video for Speed-up (optional)
```sh
python preprocess/compress_video.py --input_root [raw_video_path] --output_root [compressed_video_path]
```
This script will compress the video to *3fps* with width *224* (or height *224*). Modify the variables for your customization.
